ChurnRate Prediction

## Define a churn metrics:
In 28 consecutive calendar days, a user's balance is below 10 dollars.

## Find the churned users by the definition and label the users
The churn rate is extremely low, which makes the dataset highly imbalanced.

## Build a model to predict the churn rate
Adjust the ratio of the weights from the two classes and train the model.
Evaluate the model performance using different metrics.
